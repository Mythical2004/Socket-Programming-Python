# Socket-Programming-Python
This project is a Python-based simulation of the Go-Back-N (GBN) Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol using UDP sockets. It demonstrates reliable data transfer with sliding window control, packet loss, corruption handling, timeout retransmissions, and fast retransmit behavior â€” ideal for understanding core networking concepts.
